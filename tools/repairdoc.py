"""Repair a markdown document whose line breaks have been multiplied.

WHAT THE DAMAGE IS. Some tool in this environment has, on at least two
occasions, rewritten a markdown file with every line break multiplied -- and
the multiplier is NOT uniform across the file. `VangeliSTracker`'s `00-map.md`
came out at 91% blank lines with multipliers from 16 down to 1; this repo's
`docs/README.md` came out at 58% with a multiplier of mostly 2. The cause has
never been identified, which is exactly why this is a tool and not a one-shot.

WHY ARITHMETIC ALONE CANNOT UNDO IT. A single global divisor does not exist:
in the worst case table rows sat 16, 5, 12, 7, 4, 9, 1 and 2 blank lines apart
for what must all have been adjacency. The multiplier looks per-line, as though
each rewrite reset the padding of the lines it touched.

WHAT DOES WORK, and it is the whole trick:

  * Within a run of consecutive PROSE lines the multiplier IS constant, so the
    original gap is `gap // min(gaps in the run)`. In `00-map.md` this held for
    70 of 71 runs, quotients 1..3.
  * Tables, fenced blocks and indented code need no multiplier at all. Markdown
    forbids a blank line inside a table, and the rest read as one block.
  * A prose adjacency with no run to infer from falls back to punctuation: a
    line not ending in `.:!?` was wrapped mid-sentence, so its successor
    belongs to the same paragraph.

The repair is verifiable rather than tasteful, and the script proves it before
writing: every non-blank line must be identical in content and order, and every
non-whitespace character must be identical. It refuses to write if not.

It also reverses cp1252-as-UTF-8 mojibake, which travelled with the same
damage: an em dash read as cp1252 becomes three characters, and the reversal is
exact.
