"""Report where the assembler-transcription rule is not yet met.

The rule (docs/continuation.md, and project memory as transcribe-asm-verbatim)
is that hand-written assembler goes in verbatim and carries three things:

  1. the assembler itself;
  2. a comment on EVERY line saying what that instruction does;
  3. a block comment above holding the equivalent Pascal, labelled as
     reference only.

This checks 2 and 3 mechanically. It cannot check 1 -- that needs the binary --
so a unit passing this is not the same as a unit that has been audited.

Reporting only: it never fails a build. Parts 001, 002 and 004-007 have not
been swept yet and are expected to show up here.
