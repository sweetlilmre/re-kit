"""Catch the Pascal defects that cost the most time to diagnose from a compiler
error, because the compiler reports them somewhere other than where they are.

  nested braces   TP7 does NOT nest { } comments -- the first } closes it, so a
                  {?} or { blank } written INSIDE a block comment silently ends
                  it and the rest of the comment is parsed as code. The error
                  then appears dozens of lines later and looks unrelated.

  stray close     more } than {, usually a } used decoratively inside a comment.

  reserved words  identifiers that collide with something TP7 already means.
                  OFFSET is an assembler operator, so a parameter called Offset
                  produces "Syntax error" inside an asm block; Text is a
                  built-in type.

  DSeg addresses  Mem[DSeg:$XXXX] or Ptr(DSeg, $XXXX) reaching into our OWN
                  data segment at an address copied out of the original. This
                  one compiles, runs, and silently does nothing useful: the
                  address is where the data sits in the ORIGINAL's DGROUP, and
                  Turbo Pascal decides where ours goes. It cost a whole scene
                  -- part 003 scene 2 loaded its waypoint table to $B250, the
                  array it should have filled stayed zero, and the star tube
                  neither moved nor ran to length. Name the variable instead.
                  Mem[$A000:...] and Mem[VirtScrSeg:...] are fine; those are
                  addresses we do not own and cannot name.

Run it before reaching for the compiler:
